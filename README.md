## Installation 

You can install easily the package and its dependencies directly through pip :

The package will be automatically integrated in your python and can be directly imported as other usual packages such as pytest :

```

## Developer installation
In the case you don't want to integrate this package within your python because you want to create a python project based on this module or just develop new features, you can download the requirements packages through pip by typing the following command in the terminal :

```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

In the case, you prefer use this package and its dependencies in a virtual environment, which is highly recommended, you can do it both directly by typing :
